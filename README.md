# Harvard CS50's Mobile App Development with React Native
In the summer of 2017, I went through some of the original CS50 course. I found that it was great at teaching the fundamentals, but I was more interested in how I could apply those fundamentals to something like app development. Lo and behold, I got an email in July of 2018 which included information on a few new CS50 sponsored courses, including this one on app development!!  

Shout out to [Jordan Hayashi](https://github.com/jhhayashi) and [David Malan](https://github.com/dmalan) for putting together a great course.
